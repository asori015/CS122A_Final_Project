# Collision-Avoidance RC Car Controller

Final project for CS 122A Intermediary Embedded Systems Course.

Utilized Atmega 1284 microcontroller to provide state logic for a remote controlled car. Atmega 1284 was connected to bluetooth module which enabled external communication with bluetooth-enabled laptop. The microcontroller was reponsible for operating two brushless, DC motors that provided the RC car movement and steering, and one ultrasonic sensor that could accuratly measure short distances and therefore provide collision avoidance.
